\usage{
popedControl(
  stickyRecalcN = 4,
  maxOdeRecalc = 5,
  odeRecalcFactor = 10^(0.5),
  rxControl = NULL,
  sigdig = 4,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{stickyRecalcN}{The number of bad ODE solves before reducing
the atol/rtol for the rest of the problem.}

\item{maxOdeRecalc}{Maximum number of times to reduce the ODE
tolerances and try to resolve the system if there was a bad
ODE solve.}

\item{odeRecalcFactor}{The ODE recalculation factor when ODE
solving goes bad, this is the factor the rtol/atol is reduced}

\item{rxControl}{`rxode2` ODE solving options during fitting, created with `rxControl()`}

\item{sigdig}{Optimization significant digits. This controls:

\itemize{

 \item The tolerance of the inner and outer optimization is \code{10^-sigdig}

 \item The tolerance of the ODE solvers is
 \code{0.5*10^(-sigdig-2)}; For the sensitivity equations and
 steady-state solutions the default is \code{0.5*10^(-sigdig-1.5)}
 (sensitivity changes only applicable for liblsoda)

 \item The tolerance of the boundary check is \code{5 * 10 ^ (-sigdig + 1)}
