\usage{
pkncaControl(
  concu = NA_character_,
  doseu = NA_character_,
  timeu = NA_character_,
  volumeu = NA_character_,
  vpMult = 2,
  qMult = 1/2,
  vp2Mult = 4,
  q2Mult = 1/4,
  dvParam = "cp",
  groups = character(),
  sparse = FALSE,
  ncaData = NULL,
  ncaResults = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{concu, doseu, timeu}{concentration, dose, and time units from the source
data (passed to \code{PKNCA::pknca_units_table()}).}

\item{volumeu}{compartment volume for the model (if \code{NULL}, simplified
units from source data will be used)}

\item{vpMult, qMult, vp2Mult, q2Mult}{Multipliers for vc and cl to provide
initial estimates for vp, q, vp2, and q2}

\item{dvParam}{The parameter name in the model that should be modified for
concentration unit conversions.  It must be assigned on a line by itself,
separate from the residual error model line.}

\item{groups}{Grouping columns for NCA summaries by group (required if
\code{sparse = TRUE})}

\item{ncaData}{Data to use for calculating NCA parameters.  Typical use is
when a subset of the original data are informative for NCA.}

\item{ncaResults}{Already computed NCA results (a PKNCAresults object) to
bypass automatic calculations.  At least the following parameters must be
calculated in the NCA: tmax, cmax.dn, cl.last}
}
\value{
A list of parameters
